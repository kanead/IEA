**The Irish Ecological Association** was established in 2016 as a partner organisation to the British Ecological Society. It provides a forum for an international group of Irish-based ecologists and professionals interested in ecological science to meet, collaborate and solve ecological problems. 

With a focus on Ireland, the work of the IEA also draws on global themes relevant to ecosystems around the world. It is run on an entirely voluntary basis with free membership to the BES and non-BES members alike.

>"The IEA works in partnership with us to strengthen networks and opportunities for ecologists and evolutionary biologists in Ireland and the UK." - Joe Bloggs
